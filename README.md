# Top Strategies to Win Aviator Game in Kenya

When Aviator entered the gambling market in 2017, few people could predict that it was going to become so wildly popular. The moment it did, several large Kenyan casinos included it on their platforms, and now every Kenyan can access it via the **[link](https://aviator.me.ke)**.

If you’ve never tried playing Aviator before, hold on. Learn more about it, and then make an informed decision.   

## Explaining Aviator Rules

Playing Aviator doesn’t take much effort. All you have to do is follow these steps:

<ul>
<li>Decide how much you want to bet and wait for the new Aviator round to begin.</li>
<li>A plane will start flying: watch its progress and pay attention to how the multiplier is elevating your potential earnings.</li> 
<li>As the next step, you have to cash out. Deciding when to do it is the most important aspect of the game.</li>  
</ul>
  
You can cash out early, or you can wait for a while. The latter option will be more risky, but at the same time, it will give you a chance to win more money. 

## Extra Features of Aviator

Aviator has some extra features that you might not be able to notice right away. The first one is the auto-betting. That’s right, you can place automatic bets — in other words, you can shift the settings to make the system withdraw your account from the round. 

For instance, you can tell it to cash out when the multiplier hits 1.8x, and it will keep doing it for as long as you want.
You'll also find player stats on the **[site](https://aviator.me.ke)** that might catch your interest.

Open the table: it’s usually located under the screen with Aviator. Look at the stats for the last 10 or so matches, and gain insights into round duration, the point at which different players walk out, how much they win, etc.  

Finally, you can try placing two bets on one round. This will give you more chances to win — just make sure to use the split screens feature when betting.    

## Top 3 Aviator Strategies

There are some Aviator tricks players can use to diversify and improve their experiences.  

### Finish Most Rounds Early 

This strategy is a favorite of new players and people who appreciate their safety and don't want to take huge risks. When you start playing Aviator, wait for a couple of seconds and then cash out. Do it again and again. 

This way, you will keep winning with regular frequency. Sure, you won't win all that much, but your winnings will keep accumulating, and at some point, you will be able to feel like a real victor.

### The Martingale Aviator Strategy 

While this strategy tends to show effective results, you still have to be careful when using it. It is perfect for players who have a sufficient budget to play with and who aren't afraid of losing. 

Let's say you bet KES 10 and won. That's great — now you can repeat your bet and try winning in another round. However, if you lose it, you have to bet KES 20 next. Did you lose again? Bet KES 40. 

Most likely, you are going to win at some point, and your victory is going to cover all the expenses you have already sustained. Beware, though, because the Martingale strategy is extremely risky. 

It's not a guarantee that you will win. It is likely, yes, but who knows, you might get into a losing streak, and this won't be satisfying to you or your budget.

### Double-Bet Strategy 

You can also use the double bet feature as a part of your strategy. For example, place two bets in one round and cash out at different times. This is how your approach might look:

<ol>
<li>With the first bet, cash out early and get a guaranteed win.</li> 
<li>With the second bet, wait for a while, and cash out when the multiplier reaches a truly satisfying number.</li>  
</ol>

This will let you walk away with one definite small win and one potential big win. Pay attention to the risks, though, as they are still substantial. Use this strategy only if you are prepared to lose some money. 

If you aren’t, consider trying the **[Aviator Demo](https://aviator.me.ke)** version: it is just as fun, but it comes with zero risks.
